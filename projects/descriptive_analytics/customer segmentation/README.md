# Customer-Segmentation-using-Machine-Learning

They've provided a dataset of past purchase data at the transaction level.
# goals of this project
1. Our task is to build a clustering model using that dataset.
2. Our clustering model should factor in both aggregate sales patterns and specific items purchased.
3. To help them create customer clusters (**customer segmentation**) through a data-driven approach.

**Note:** This project is based on Unsupervised Learning, Data Analysis to clustering using K-mean.

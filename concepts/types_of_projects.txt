1.Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is the act of analyzing words to determine sentiments and opinions that may be positive or negative in polarity.

2.Fake News Detection

fake news is false information and hoaxes spread through social media and other online media to achieve a political agenda. In this data science project idea, we will use Python to build a model that can accurately detect whether a piece of news is real or fake.

3.Speech Emotion Recognition

This data science project uses librosa to perform Speech Emotion Recognition. SER is the process of trying to recognize human emotion and affective states from speech.

4.Driver Drowsiness detection

Drowsy driving is extremely dangerous and around thousands of accidents happen each year due to drivers falling asleep while driving. In this Python project, we will build a system that can detect sleepy drivers and also alert them by beeping alarm.

5.Credit Card Fraud Detection

In this project, we’ll use R with algorithms like Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks, and Gradient Boosting Classifier. We’ll use the Card Transactions dataset to classify credit card transactions into fraudulent and genuine.

6.Movie Recommendation System

A recommendation system sends out suggestions to users through a filtering process based on other users’ preferences and browsing history.

7.Customer Segmentation

Customer Segmentation is a popular application of unsupervised learning. Using clustering, companies identify segments of customers to target the potential user base.

8.Uber Data Analysis

This is a data visualization project with ggplot2 where we’ll use R and its libraries and analyze various parameters like trips by the hours in a day and trips during months in a year. We’ll use the Uber Pickups in New York City dataset and create visualizations for different time-frames of the year.

**About This repository** : focuses on hypothesis testing techniques in data analysis. It features Python scripts, datasets, and step-by-step examples to demonstrate concepts like null and alternative hypotheses, p-values, t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA. Perfect for anyone aiming to understand and apply statistical testing in real-world scenarios.

**Hypothesis testing is like being a detective trying to figure out if something is true.** You have two ideas: <br>

**Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: There's no difference in the average fare between credit card and cash customers. <br>
**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: There's a difference in the average fare between credit card and cash customers. <br>

## Steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather fare data based on payment method (credit card vs. cash). <br>
2. **Test Statistic**: Calculate the test statistic (like a t-statistic) to measure the difference between the two groups. <br>
3. **Set Significance Level (α)**: Choose a threshold (usually 0.05) to decide if the result is significant. <br>
4. **Decision Rule**: <br>
    If the p-value is less than 0.05 (p < α), reject the null hypothesis (H₀). <br>
    If the p-value is greater than or equal to 0.05 (p ≥ α), fail to reject the null hypothesis. <br>
